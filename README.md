# Japanese-CSS-Colors
A set of CSS variables covering 221 traditional Japanese colors

## How to Use
Use sample_table.html to find the color you want to use.  The rows in the table are styled inline to make it easy to find the color that was used for a given row.

From there just use the variable name inside `var()`, as shown in the following example:

```css
body {
	background: var(--benihi);
	color: var(--aijiro);
}
```
